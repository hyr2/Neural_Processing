# TODO
# (1) read source time series and their meta-information
# (2) split into trials and align time series for each trial.
# (3) make sure the two timeseries have the same sampling rate by interpolation or downsampling
# (4) Calculate cross correlation for each trial and find peak time & normalized peak value.
# (5) Plot demo for each unit; plot peaks over longitudinal.
