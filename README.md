# Neural_Processing
All of the code that was developed during my time at Rice University while pursuing a PhD in Neuroengineering in Dr. Lan Luan's lab. The code is useful for processing trial based electrophysiology datasets recorded with the Intan recording system (128 channels). This repo contains LFP analysis code and spiking data processing pipelines and are written in both Python and MATLAB. 

This repo also contains image processing codes for hyperspectral intrinsic imaging as well as laser speckle contrast imaging.
