Analyze the low frequency signals in the neural recordings from invasive intracortical electrodes. Trial based measurements are assumed. 
128 channel Intan device used for recording. CSD plots generated, Morlet wavelets for time frequency plots and analysis of changes in 
PSD (power spectral density) along the entire electrode array (data for NET arrays-4 shank-128 channels).

Evoked potentials are also analyzed.

MUA (300-3 KHz) signals are also analyzed.

Correlations matrices and their evolution in time during stimulation and post stimulation.
